# üì¶ Dependencies Guide

**‚Üê [Back to Home](README.md)**

## üîç Package Overview

Rejoice uses carefully selected packages for privacy, performance, and reliability. All processing happens locally on your device.

## üêç Core Python Dependencies

### üé§ Audio Processing
```python
sounddevice==0.5.1
# Real-time audio recording from microphone
# Why: Cross-platform, low-latency audio capture
# Privacy: Local only, no network access
# Alternative: Built-in audio modules (but less reliable)
```

```python
numpy>=1.21.0
# Numerical operations for audio data processing
# Why: Efficient audio buffer manipulation, required by sounddevice
# Privacy: Mathematical library, no data collection
# Size: ~20MB, fundamental to audio processing
```

### ü§ñ AI Transcription
```python
openai-whisper>=20231117
# Local speech-to-text AI model (OpenAI's Whisper)
# Why: Best accuracy for offline transcription, runs locally
# Privacy: NO API calls to OpenAI - completely offline after download
# Models: Downloads 39MB-1.5GB models to your computer
# Security: Open source, auditable, runs in isolated environment
```

```python
torch>=2.0.0
# PyTorch machine learning framework (required by Whisper)
# Why: Whisper models run on PyTorch for AI inference
# Privacy: Local computation only, no telemetry  
# Size: ~800MB-2GB depending on your system (CPU vs GPU)
# Note: Large but essential for AI model execution
```

### üóÇÔ∏è File Handling
```python
python-dotenv>=1.0.0
# Environment variable management for configuration
# Why: Secure storage of user settings in .env files
# Privacy: Local file storage, no external access
# Size: <1MB, lightweight configuration management
```

```python
pyyaml>=6.0
# YAML parsing for output file frontmatter
# Why: Creates structured metadata in transcript files
# Privacy: Local file processing only
# Alternative: JSON (but YAML is more human-readable)
```

### üåê Local AI Integration (Optional)
```python
requests>=2.31.0
# HTTP client for Ollama API communication
# Why: Communicate with local Ollama instance (localhost:11434)
# Privacy: ONLY connects to localhost - no external requests
# Security: All traffic stays on your computer
# Without Ollama: This dependency is unused, no network activity
```

### üñ•Ô∏è System Integration
```python
pyaudio>=0.2.11
# Alternative audio backend (fallback for sounddevice)
# Why: Backup audio system if sounddevice fails
# Privacy: Local hardware access only
# Platform: May require additional system libraries
```

## üñ•Ô∏è System Dependencies

#### Xcode Command Line Tools
```bash
xcode-select --install
```
- **What it is:** System compilers and build tools
- **Why needed:** Compile Python packages with C extensions
- **Security:** Official Apple development tools
- **Size:** ~500MB, one-time installation

### Linux Requirements

#### System Audio Libraries
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev python3-pyaudio

# Fedora/CentOS
sudo dnf install portaudio-devel python3-pyaudio

# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S portaudio python-pyaudio
```

### Windows Requirements

#### Visual Studio Build Tools
- **Download:** [Microsoft C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)
- **Why needed:** Compile Python packages with C extensions
- **Alternative:** Full Visual Studio Community (free)

## ü§ñ AI Models

### Whisper Models (Required)
Downloaded automatically during setup:

| Model  | Size    | RAM Usage | Accuracy | Use Case |
|--------|---------|-----------|----------|----------|
| tiny   | 39 MB   | ~390 MB   | Good     | Testing, low-resource systems |
| base   | 74 MB   | ~500 MB   | Better   | General use, older computers |
| small  | 244 MB  | ~1 GB     | Very Good| **Recommended default** |
| medium | 769 MB  | ~2 GB     | Excellent| Professional transcription |
| large  | 1550 MB | ~4 GB     | Best     | Critical accuracy needs |

**Storage location:** `~/.cache/whisper/` (can be deleted to free space)

### Ollama Models (Optional)
For AI-generated filenames and metadata:

| Model      | Size  | RAM Usage | Quality | Download Command |
|------------|-------|-----------|---------|------------------|
| gemma3:4b  | 2.5GB | ~3 GB     | Excellent | `ollama pull gemma3:4b` |
| llama3     | 4.7GB | ~5 GB     | Excellent | `ollama pull llama3` |
| qwen3:0.6b | 350MB | ~500 MB   | Good    | `ollama pull qwen3:0.6b` |
| phi3       | 2.3GB | ~3 GB     | Very Good | `ollama pull phi3` |

**Storage location:** `~/.ollama/models/` (managed by Ollama)

## üîí Security Information

### Privacy Guarantees
- ‚úÖ **All audio processing on your device** - Whisper runs locally
- ‚úÖ **No OpenAI API calls** - Uses downloaded models, not cloud services
- ‚úÖ **No cloud AI services** - Ollama runs locally
- ‚úÖ **No internet required** after initial setup
- ‚úÖ **Zero telemetry** - No usage data collected
- ‚úÖ **Zero external requests** (except to localhost Ollama)

### Network Activity Verification
The only network request is to `localhost:11434` (local Ollama):
```python
# From src/transcribe.py line 38
response = requests.post("http://localhost:11434/api/chat", ...)
```

You can verify this by:
1. **Reading the source code** - All network requests visible
2. **Network monitoring** - Use tools like Little Snitch, Wireshark
3. **Offline testing** - Disconnect internet, transcription still works

### Package Security
- **All packages from PyPI** - Official Python package repository
- **Open source dependencies** - Code is auditable
- **No proprietary packages** - Everything can be inspected
- **Minimal dependencies** - Reduced attack surface

## üóëÔ∏è Disk Space Usage

### Typical Installation
- **Python packages:** ~100MB
- **Whisper small model:** ~244MB  
- **Ollama + model:** ~2.5GB (optional)
- **System dependencies:** ~500MB
- **Total:** ~1GB (without Ollama) or ~3.5GB (with Ollama)

### Cleaning Up
```bash
# Remove Whisper model cache
rm -rf ~/.cache/whisper/

# Remove specific Ollama model  
ollama rm gemma3:4b

# Uninstall Python packages
pip uninstall -r requirements.txt

# Remove Homebrew audio (macOS)
brew uninstall portaudio
```

## üöÄ Performance Optimization

### For Lower RAM Usage
1. **Use smaller Whisper model:** `tiny` or `base`
2. **Use smaller Ollama model:** `qwen3:0.6b` 
3. **Reduce chunk duration:** Less buffering
4. **Fewer worker threads:** Lower parallel processing

### For Better Accuracy
1. **Use larger Whisper model:** `medium` or `large`
2. **More RAM:** Enables larger models
3. **Better microphone:** Hardware quality matters
4. **Quiet environment:** Reduce background noise

### For Faster Processing
1. **SSD storage:** Faster model loading
2. **More CPU cores:** Better parallel processing
3. **GPU acceleration:** PyTorch can use CUDA/Metal
4. **Optimal chunk size:** Balance latency vs efficiency

## ‚ùì Dependency FAQ

### "Why not use OpenAI's API directly?"
- **Privacy:** API sends your audio to their servers
- **Cost:** API charges per minute of audio
- **Offline:** API requires internet connection
- **Control:** Local models give you full control

### "Can I use different AI models?"
- **Whisper:** Stick with official OpenAI models (best accuracy)
- **Ollama:** Try different models for metadata generation
- **Custom:** Advanced users can modify the code

### "Why so many dependencies?"
- **Audio:** Cross-platform audio is complex
- **AI:** Modern AI models require substantial frameworks
- **Reliability:** Fallbacks and error handling need extra packages
- **Features:** Rich functionality requires specialized libraries

### "Is this bloated?"
- **Compared to cloud services:** Larger initial download, but then completely offline
- **Compared to professional tools:** Much smaller than Adobe Audition, etc.
- **Functionality:** Each package serves a specific, essential purpose

## üîß Alternative Configurations

### Minimal Setup (Python only)
```bash
pip install openai-whisper sounddevice numpy
# ~300MB total, basic transcription only
```

### Audio-Only (No Homebrew)
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
# May have audio compatibility issues
```

### No AI Features
```bash
pip install openai-whisper sounddevice numpy python-dotenv
# Skip Ollama, requests - timestamp-only filenames
```
